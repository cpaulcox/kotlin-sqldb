== Delegated Property Datasource

- Configured via a companion object
- Referenced in the application code

=== Configuring a Datasource/Connection Pool

Configure in startup code or a test

[source, kotlin]
----

val config = HikariConfig().apply {
  poolName = "SQLitePool"
  driverClassName = "org.sqlite.JDBC"
  jdbcUrl = "jdbc:sqlite::memory:"
  connectionTestQuery = "SELECT 1"
  maxLifetime = 60000 // 60 Sec
  idleTimeout = 45000 // 45 Sec
  maximumPoolSize = 50 // 50 Connections (including idle connections)
}

DataSource.dataSource = HikariDataSource(config)

----

=== Getting a Connection

[source, kotlin]
----
val conn1 : Connection by DataSource
----

To use - get a connection wrapped in try-with-resources and nest the `transaction {}` inside.

Need to ensure that one `val` and all subsequent reads use the same connection but this connection should not be shared
between `val`s. May have to remove the companion and use `val conn1 : Connection by DataSource()` instead.
